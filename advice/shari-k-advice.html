                <h4>Consistency is Key!</h4>
                <p>Nothing ever happens by itself, right? So if you want to make a change and learn something new, of course it will take some time! The best way to ensure that is to set a time and place for regular practice. It works for piano (or knitting, juggling, whatever is your thing...), right?</p>
 
                <p>To keep it up, though, you need to be able to tolerate hitting the wrong notes sometimes.  You may have to fiddle with things a bit to see what isn't working.  Don't worry, a LOT of resources are available to get you back in tune.</p>
 
                <h4>Be fearless -- and don't expect to know what you are doing.</h4>
                <p>This is one of those "fake it till you make it" experiences.  I mean, we learn new skills by doing them.  That means using code we don't really "understand" at first, so that later it will be familiar -- and understandable!</p>
                <h4>Have fun!</h4>
                <p>Learning new things and enjoying the experience is hard-wired into human beings.  At least, the joy of succeeding is. Celebrate every little victory -- we've got this!</p>
